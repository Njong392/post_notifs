# ⚙️How does it work?
Users sign up and create an account, and so automatically subcribe to receive notifications from the post office when they receive a package. Because their information is registered in the database, when a package with the same details are keyed in by the post office admin, the recipient is immediately alerted about the package. The user also gets alerts when the status of their packages change.
